# ArgoX Protocol Implementation - Interaction DEMO

## 1. Introduction
`ArgoX Protocol` is a decentralized exchange based on Limit Order Book. It combines the Lightning Network (State channel) and a batching mechanism to increase speed and throughput while reducing the gas usage of the exchange. *This is our final university project, and it has not been published yet.*

This repository serves as the front-end of the interactive demonstration, which uses the [github.com/NguyenHiu/ArgoX-Implementation](https://github.com/NguyenHiu/ArgoX-Implementation/tree/interaction-demo) as the back-end. 

## 2. Execution
Don't forget to install the dependencies using `npm install`.

Before executing this application, you need to start the service in [github.com/NguyenHiu/ArgoX-Implementation](https://github.com/NguyenHiu/ArgoX-Implementation/tree/interaction-demo) repository to serve as the back-end of this application.

After that, you can run the front-end application using the following command:
```
npm start
